Gathers all of your international podcast reviews from iTunes and displays them in a table.

== Description ==

Gathers all of your international podcast reviews from iTunes and displays them in a table with sortable columns. This plugin also checks for new reviews in the background every 4 hours. Note: sometimes the iTunes feeds for certain countries are unreachable, and you can click the button to manually check for new reviews.

We're working on a new service for checking your international podcast reviews. It will include features like email notifications, charts, filtering, multiple podcasts, and more. For more information and to find out when we launch, please [enter your email here](http://eepurl.com/bhU4SD).
